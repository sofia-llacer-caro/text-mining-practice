# Text mining library project

## Usage
First, you can download the contents of the repository and create a virtual environment. Then, use
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
in the command line in order to install the required packages and dependencies. And we should be all good to play around with the scripts!
## Scripts included
There are 3 scripts included:\
    - ```manager.py```: here are all the definitions of the functions.\
    - ```config.py```: intended for the user to play around with. Contains the location of the text to be mined, as well as words with particular (un)importance.\
    - ```main.py```: main script to be run and where the functions defined are applied.

## Example
An example text is provided under ```sample_texts```. I decided to choose one in Spanish as a small challenge because it has more characters and punctuation signs than English.
