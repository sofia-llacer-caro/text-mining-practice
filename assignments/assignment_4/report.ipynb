That way, we would be able to produce a file with the fields relevant to the questions, and discuss the way they could be used in the current notebook. For more details on the preprocessing pipeline, the way this data was generated and the tools used, feel free to have a look at the source python file included in this directory."

For this, we selected those for which the rating of purchase in winter months over all purchases is higher than 0.5 (indicating more than half the purchases of this product are done over winter). We also added the number of reviews, because otherwise there could be a case where a product has 1 purchase and just happened to be in winter. We also added those that are relatively positive rating, as people would order it again next year if they were happy with it before. On the other side, if the reviews are bad from previous year, it is less likely there will be demand for it as users will see the rating and not want to order it.
