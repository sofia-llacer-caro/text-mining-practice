    "In order to elaborate the report, we considered that it would be clearer to first preprocess the review data through the script `preprocessing_pipeline.py`. That way, we would be able to produce a file with the fields relevant to the questions, and discuss the way they could be used in the current notebook. For more details on the preprocessing pipeline, the way this data was generated and the tools used, feel free to have a look at the source python file included in this directory."
